Command line basics

Open your CLI (Terminal for Mac, Git Bash for windows)
Use the cd command to navigate to your desktop directory (everyone’s will be a little different so I can’t say exactly how to get there). You will most likely need to use a mix of ls and cd.Use ls to list out the contents of the current directory you're in so you can see where you can cd into.
If you are on Windows you might have to go into your OneDrive first to find your desktop.
Once you make it to your desktop in the command line, use pwd to verify that you are there. It could look something like user/username/desktop the last directory in the path is the current directory you are in.
Close your command line and open it again. Repeat steps 1-3. Repetition is important.
Can you do it even faster?
Now that you are in your desktop directory on the command line, make a new directory called cli_practice. You should actually see the folder on your desktop now.
mkdir cli_practice is the command you will use
Run the command ls and you should also see on the command line that the directory has been created.
Now, move into the new directory you just created and check your current working directory.
Now create two directories with one command. One directory should be called super_visible_directory and the other should be called .super_secret_directory . Make sure to keep the period in front of the .super_secret_directory , it’s not a typo. 
Now if you open the folder using either Finder or Explorer on your computer, you will see the super_visible_directory but not the other.
In the command line run the command ls and you will still only see the super_visible_directory.
Now run ls -a , this command will also list any hidden files and folders. You should now also see your .super_secret_directory
Check your current working directory, you should still be in the cli_practice directory.
Use the following command to create 2 files at the same time, 				touch visible.txt .secret.txt you should “see” the visible.txt file in the Finder/Explorer folder but you won’t see the .secret.txt file. If you run the ls -a command in the command line you will see the hidden file there.
Now let's move each file to their respective directories. Use the mv command to move the visible.txt file to the super_visible_directory. Then move the .secret.txt file to the .super_secret_directory .
If you run ls -a while in the cli_practice directory you should see no output in the command line. This means you moved the files out of this directory. Good job!
Now move into your .super_secret_directory
Check the current directory and make sure you moved correctly
List out all of the contents of the directory. Make sure to use the extra option to see hidden files and folders.
While in the .super_secret_directory list out the contents of the super_visible_directory without moving to that directory.
Now, in one command move to the super_visible_directory
Check your current directory and make sure you are now in super_visible_directory and not still in the .super_secret_directory
Use cd command to return to your HOME path.
Now use the cd command to get into the super_visible_directory in one command. You will have to make sure to chain your path correctly all the way from your HOME path.
